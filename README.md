## API Document ##
Pharos Anchor provides a set of REST APIs for its operations. Descriptions for the APIs are stored in <root>/doc folder.
- **[pharos_anchor_api_for_single_device.yaml](https://github.sec.samsung.net/RS7-EdgeComputing/system-pharos-anchor-go/blob/master/doc/pharos_anchor_api_for_single_device.yaml)**
  - Describes APIs of service deployment for single device
- **[pharos_anchor_api_for_multiple_devices.yaml](https://github.sec.samsung.net/RS7-EdgeComputing/system-pharos-anchor-go/blob/master/doc/pharos_anchor_api_for_multiple_devices.yaml)**
  - Describes APIs of group management with a number of devices and service deployment in a group manner

Note that you can visit [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to graphically investigate the REST APIs in YAML.

## How to work ##
#### 0. Prerequisites ####
  - 1 PC with Ubuntu 14.04(or above) and Docker
  - Pharos Anchor Docker image
    - Please see the above explaination to know how to build Pharos Anchor Docker image
  - Pharos Node Docker image
    - Please visit [Pharos Node project](https://github.sec.samsung.net/RS7-EdgeComputing/system-pharos-node-go) to know how to build Pharos Node Docker image

#### 1. Run Pharos Anchor and Pharos Node containers ####
Run Pharos Anchor container:
```shell
$ docker run -it -p 48099:48099 -v /pharos-anchor/data/db:/data/db system-pharos-anchor-go-ubuntu
```
Run Pharos Node container:
```shell
$ docker run -it -p 48098:48098 -e ANCHOR_ADDRESS=<Pharos Anchor IP> -e NODE_ADDRESS=<Pharos Node IP> -v /pharos-node/data/db:/data/db -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock system-pharos-node-go-ubuntu
```

#### 2. Register Pharos Node to Pharos Anchor ####
If you want to verify if the Node is successfully registered to the Anchor, you can send a request as below:

```shell
$ curl -X GET "http://<Pharos Anchor IP>:48099/api/v1/management/nodes" -H "accept: application/json"

{"nodes":[{"apps":[],"config":{"deviceid":"54919CA5-4101-4AE4-595B-353C51AA983C","devicename":"Edge #1","location":"Human readable location","manufacturer":"Manufacturer Name","modelnumber":"Model number as designated by the manufacturer","os":"Operationg system name and version","pinginterval":"10","platform":"Platform name and version","serialnumber":"Serial number"},"id":" "","ip":"<Pharos Anchor IP>","status":"connected"}]}
$
```
Note that values of the above configuration will be changed, later. Only you care is "id" field which is used for an unique identifier of a device that the Node is running on. With the ID, you can send a request of service deployment to the device. Also, you can inspect the device with the ID, not all registered devices as below:
```shell
$ curl -X GET "http://<Pharos Anchor IP>:48099/api/v1/management/nodes/5a69599a1fee050007865f3a" -H "accept: application/json"

{"apps":[],"config":{"deviceid":"54919CA5-4101-4AE4-595B-353C51AA983C","devicename":"Edge #1","location":"Human readable location","manufacturer":"Manufacturer Name","modelnumber":"Model number as designated by the manufacturer","os":"Operationg system name and version","pinginterval":"10","platform":"Platform name and version","serialnumber":"Serial number"},"id":"5a695f2ad5fd9300089dbd91","ip":"<Pharos Anchor IP>","status":"connected"}
$
```
Note that **5a69599a1fee050007865f3a** will be used as a **node ID** of Pharos Node device.

#### 3. Deploy a new service to Pharos Node device ####
Before deploying a new service to a device, you should write a docker-compose YAML file to describe how to run the service. For example, let's deploy MongoDB service. For the deployment, the below description in YAML will be used:
```shell
version: '2'
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: "mongodb"
    volumes:
      - ./data/db:/data/db
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
```
Note that, the above YAML description is absolutly identical to one for docker-compose tool and can define a number of containers. We called a unit of the containers an **application**.

Then, let's send a request to install a new application consisting of a MongoDB service to the Node's device:
```shell
$ curl -X POST "http://<Pharos Anchor IP>:48099/api/v1/management/nodes/5a695f2ad5fd9300089dbd91/apps/deploy" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "version: '2'
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: "mongodb"
    volumes:
      - ./data/db:/data/db
    ports:
      - 27017:27017"

{"description":"services:\n  mongodb:\n    container_name: mongodb\n    image: mongo:latest\n    ports:\n    - 27017:27017\n    volumes:\n    - ./data/db:/data/db\nversion: \"2\"\n","id":"1f04ccc14635062ad8a478d08dd94ebdd934efa5","images":[{"name":"mongo"}],"services":[{"name":"mongodb","state":{"ExitCode":"0","Status":"running"}}],"state":"DEPLOY"}
$
```
If the MongoDB service is successfully installed, you can check it as below:
```shell
<Pharos Node Machine> $ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES
3bd2b0ec8126        mongo:latest                     "docker-entrypoint.s…"   8 seconds ago       Up 7 seconds        0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp   mongodb
```
Note that **1f04ccc14635062ad8a478d08dd94ebdd934efa5** will be used as a **App ID** of a service of Pharos Node device.
#### 4. Update/Stop/Delete an existing service in Pharos Node device ####

Note that starting, stopping, updating, and deleting an application will be applied to all corresponding containers defined in the application. For example, deleting an application will stop all containers and erase all Docker images defined in an application.

To update a MongoDB service in Pharos Node device if an update of the service is availble, send a corresponding request as below:
```shell
$ curl -X POST "http://<Pharos Anchor IP>:48099/api/v1/management/nodes/5a695f2ad5fd9300089dbd91/apps/1f04ccc14635062ad8a478d08dd94ebdd934efa5/update" -H "accept: application/json"
```

To stop a running service or start a paused service, send corresponding requests as below, respectively:
```shell
(For stop a running service)
$ curl -X POST "http://<Pharos Anchor IP>:48099/api/v1/management/nodes/5a695f2ad5fd9300089dbd91/apps/1f04ccc14635062ad8a478d08dd94ebdd934efa5/stop" -H "accept: application/json"

(For start a paused service)
$ curl -X POST "http://<Pharos Anchor IP>:48099/api/v1/management/nodes/5a695f2ad5fd9300089dbd91/apps/1f04ccc14635062ad8a478d08dd94ebdd934efa5/start" -H "accept: application/json"
```

To stop a service and delete a corresponding Docker image, send a corresponding request as below:
```shell
$ curl -X DELETE "http://<Pharos Anchor IP>:48099/api/v1/management/nodes/5a695f2ad5fd9300089dbd91/apps/1f04ccc14635062ad8a478d08dd94ebdd934efa5" -H "accept: application/json"
```
